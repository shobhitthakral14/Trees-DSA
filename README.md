  Introduction to Trees
  
  A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and pointers to child nodes. The root node is the topmost node, and a tree is traversed via edges.

Key Properties:
A tree has one root node.
Each child node has one parent (except the root, which has none).
A node without children is called a leaf.
Common Tree Types
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Balanced Trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Tree)
N-ary Tree
Segment Tree
Trie (Prefix Tree)
Heap (Max/Min Heap)
